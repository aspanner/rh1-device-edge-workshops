# Demo: Summit Connect 2023

This demo is a deep dive on [Red Hat Device Edge](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/meet-red-hat-device-edge-with-microshift)'s functionality, including an introduction to [Image Builder](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-an-image-builder) and the [infra.osbuild](https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.osbuild) Ansible collection, [greenboot](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/automating-rhel-edge-image-rollback-greenboot), and [microshift](https://next.redhat.com/project/microshift/). Particular attention will be given to building applications into an image, along with configuring health checks to trigger rollbacks.

## Demo Presentation

This demo is presentor-led, and the slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nxa7rX1fmQiy6uTuWPxdBWe46jso9x9CYIkurDBT8mA) for Red Hatters or [here](../../decks/summit_connect_2023-RHDE_deep_dive.pdf) for everyone.

This demo can be given using edge devices or by simply using virtual machines on a laptop, depending on what's easier.

## Additional Presentations

The exercises are self explanatory and guide the participants through the entire lab. All concepts are explained as they are introduced.
